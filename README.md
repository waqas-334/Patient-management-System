# Patient Management System

This patient management system is a Java-based application created as a semester project during my undergraduate degree. It allows for efficient management of patient records and provides features to add patients, doctors, assign patients to doctors, and more. The application is built using Java, the NetBeans IDE, and Microsoft Access as the database.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** The system provides user authentication with an admin login for enhanced security and control.
- **Add Patients:** Admin can add new patients to the system with detailed information.
- **Add Doctors:** Admin can add new doctors, complete with their credentials and specialization.
- **Assign Patients to Doctors:** The system allows admin to assign patients to specific doctors for better management.
- **Record Management:** Keep track of patient records, including medical history, treatments, and appointments.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application has an intuitive and compelling graphical user interface.
